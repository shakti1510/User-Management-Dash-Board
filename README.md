# ServletProject_User_Management_System

Welcome to the **ServletProject_User_Management_System**! This project is a comprehensive user management system designed to demonstrate the power and flexibility of Java technologies, specifically within the Eclipse J2EE edition environment. Utilizing a robust stack comprising Java, Hibernate, Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and Apache Tomcat, this application offers a solid foundation for understanding how to manage user data effectively in a web application context.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **ServletProject_User_Management_System** is designed to provide a hands-on experience with a typical CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, enhanced with user authentication and session management features. It showcases how different Java technologies can be integrated to create a dynamic and responsive web application.

### üõ† Tech Stack

- **Java**: The core programming language used to build the server-side logic.
- **Hibernate**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for Java, used for database operations, making it easier to interact with the database in an object-oriented manner.
- **Servlet**: A Java programming language class used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: A technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types.
- **Apache Tomcat**: An open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language, and Java WebSocket technologies, providing a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code to run.

## üìê Project Flowchart

The flow of the **ServletProject_User_Management_System** can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **User Registration/Login**:
   - Users can register by providing their details.
   - Upon registration, users can log in using their credentials.
   - üõ° Authentication checks are performed to ensure data security.

2. **Dashboard Access**:
   - After successful login, users are directed to the dashboard.
   - The dashboard provides options to view, add, edit, or delete user information.

3. **User Management Operations (CRUD)**:
   - **Create**: Add new user details.
   - **Read**: View existing user details.
   - **Update**: Modify details of existing users.
   - **Delete**: Remove user details from the system.

4. **Session Management**:
   - User sessions are managed throughout the application to maintain state and security.
   - Users are logged out after a period of inactivity or upon clicking the logout button.

5. **Database Interactions**:
   - Hibernate is used for ORM purposes, facilitating smooth interactions with the database for CRUD operations.

6. **Server Deployment**:
   - The application is deployed on Apache Tomcat, making it accessible via a web browser.
